# Module 1 — Image Preprocessing & Defect Detection (Image Subtraction)

---

## Objective

The objective of this module is to detect defects in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) images by comparing defected PCB images with defect-free reference templates using classical image processing techniques.

This module forms the **first stage** of the PCB Defect Detection System and prepares defect localization outputs for further ROI extraction and CNN-based classification.

---

## Methodology

The defect detection pipeline follows a reference-based comparison approach.

### 1️) Image Loading & Alignment

* Load **template (defect-free)** PCB image.
* Load **test PCB image** containing defects.
* Resize test image to match template dimensions for accurate comparison.

---

### 2️) Image Preprocessing

To enhance defect visibility and reduce noise:

* Convert images to grayscale.
* Apply **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)** to improve contrast.
* Apply **Gaussian Blur** to suppress noise and small intensity variations.

---

### 3️) Image Subtraction

The difference between template and test image is computed:

[
Difference = |Template - Test|
]

This highlights structural changes corresponding to PCB defects.

---

### 4️) Otsu Thresholding

Automatic thresholding is applied using **Otsu’s Method**:

* Determines optimal threshold automatically.
* Eliminates illumination dependency.
* Produces binary defect regions without manual tuning.

---

### 5️) Morphological Processing

To refine detected regions:

* Morphological Opening removes noise.
* Dilation strengthens defect areas.
* Improves contour detection accuracy.

---

### 6️) Defect Localization Using Contours

OpenCV contour detection is used to identify defect regions.

For each detected contour:

* Calculate contour area.
* Extract bounding box coordinates.
* Filter very small noise regions.

---

### 7️) Defect Annotation (Visualization Approach)

Instead of storing only binary masks, defects are visualized directly on PCB images:

* 🟢 **Major Defect** → Large contour area
* 🔴 **Minor Defect** → Small contour area

Bounding boxes are drawn around detected defects for intuitive interpretation.

This visualization approach makes results easier for human inspection and presentation.
